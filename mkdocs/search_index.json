It's children include \nOddView\n, \nOddCollection\n, \nMedia\n, \nArticle\n, \nEvent\n, \nExternal\n, and \nPromotion\n. It provides many convienence methods that help you sort through data received from the API such as \ngetIncluded\n, \ngetIncludedByType\n, \ngetIncludedByRelationship\n, \ngetIdentifiersByRelationship\n, and \nfindIncludedByIdentifier\n. These getter methods can return any combination of \nOddObject\n's subclass objects depending on how you've configured your data on the Oddworks dashboard.\n\n\nOddView\n\n\nThe \nOddView\n class makes it possible to retreive and store large amounts of data from the API with a single call. This view contains \"relationships\" and \"included\" pieces of data that can be accessed via \nOddObject\n's convienence methods. When constructing applications you may find it helpful to package things such as your navigation and the initial data shown on application load into an \nOddView\n.\n\n\nOddCollection\n\n\nThe \nOddCollection\n class makes it possible to group together other entities for explicit display. Depending on how you configure your Collection on the Oddworks dashboard it can contain a description, a preview image, a release date, a title, an ID, a related \nIdentifier\n object, relationships, included \nOddObject\ns, and a type.\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nThe \nMedia\n class can represent any type of playable media to users. This could be a VOD, HLS Stream, DASH Stream, etc. Depending on how you configure your Media on the Oddworks dashboard it can contain a description, a duration, ad support information, a preview image, an explicitly stated player to use, a release date, sharing information, a title, a URL, an ID, a related \nIdentifier\n object, relationships, included \nOddObject\ns (such as related videos), and a type.\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nThe \nArticle\n class represents a news item that can be displayed in the application. Depending on how you configure your Article on the Oddworks dashboard it can contain a description, a title, a preview image, a URL to link to, a category, a source, a created at timestamp, a related \nIdentifier\n object, relationships, included \nOddObject\ns (such as related articles), and a type.\n\n\nEvent\n\n\nThe \nEvent\n class is similar to the \nArticle\n class but it is used specifically for informing users of events that will or have occured. Depending on how you configure your Event on the Oddworks dashboard it can contain a description, a title, a preview image, a URL to link to, a category, a source, a created at timestamp, a start time, an end time, a location, a related \nIdentifier\n object, relationships, included \nOddObject\ns (such as related events), and a type. There is also the convienence methos of \nisMultiDayEvent\n in case you need to update your UI based on datetime formatting.\n\n\nExternal\n\n\nThe \nExternal\n class is used to handle any webpage you'd like to embed in your application. Depending on how you configure your External on the Oddworks dashboard it can contain a description, a title, a preview image, a URL to link to, a related \nIdentifier\n object, relationships, included \nOddObject\ns (such as related externals), and a type.\n\n\nPromotion\n\n\nThe \nPromotion\n class is used to handle any type of promotion you may want to put in the application. Depending on how you configure your Promotion on the Oddworks dashboard it can contain a description, a title, a preview image, a related \nIdentifier\n object, relationships, included \nOddObject\ns (such as related externals), and a type.",

We are first getting the \nhomeView\n from our main application class. In the Oddworks dashboard we've set up relationships on this View with the keys of \"featuredMedia and \"featuredCollections\". We use the \ngetIdentifiersByRelationship\n so that we can use the \nOddStore\n's \ngetObject\n method to retrieve the featured media and featured collection objects later in the method. We check to make sure that each List of Identifiers is not null or empty and grab the object from the \nOddStore\n. We take this a step further with the \ngetIncludedByRelationship\n method called on the \nfeaturedCollection\n. This will give us a list of \nOddObject\ns that can be used in a RecyclerView. \nNote: We're casting the objects in the \nfeaturedCollectionEntities\n to \nOddObject\ns because it may contain any combination of data types.\n\n\nApply Data\n\n\nDisplaying a Preview Image\n\n\nNow that we've extracted the data we need from the \nhomeView\n we're going to show the user the preview image for the \nfeaturedMedia\n object. In order to render an image, we're going to rely on the \nGlide\n library, though there are many other options such as \nPicasso\n, \nImageLoader\n, and \nFresco\n. Add the Glide library to your project via Gradle or Maven.\n\n\nAfter calling the \nconfigureData\n method, we're going to call a new method called \nconfigureView\n.\n\n\n// app/java/sample.oddworks.com.myoddworksapplication/HomeActivity\n\n// ...\nprivate void configureView() {\n    ImageView featuredMediaPreviewImage = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.featuredMediaPreviewImage);\n    Glide.with(context)\n            .load(featuredMedia.getMediaImage().getAspect16x9())\n            .placeholder(R.drawable.preview_tile_16x9)\n            .into(featuredMediaPreviewImage);\n}\n// ...\n\n\n\n\nWe've created an \nImageView\n with an ID of \nfeaturedMediaPreviewImage\n in the \nactivity_home\n layout file that is being targeted in the \nconfigureView\n method. We want to use an image with an aspect ratio of 16x9, although we do have other options. You'll also notice that we have set a placeholder via a drawable file. This is best practice because it allows for the view layout to have the correct structure on load instead of changing it after Glide has loaded the image from the \nfeaturedMedia\n object.\n\n\nCreating a Dynamic Recycler View\n\n\nSince the \nfeaturedCollectionEntities\n list can contain different types of \nOddObject\ns we'll need to create a dynamic \nRecyclerView\n to handle anything that gets put into it. For this example, we'll handle the case of the List containing \nMedia\n and \nOddCollection\n objects. In order to make use of the \nRecyclerView\n class we'll need to add it to our dependencies in our \nbuild.gradle\n file:\n\n\ndependencies {\n    // ...\n    compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:+'\n}\n\n\n\nWe'll add a \nRecyclerView\n to our \nactivity_home\n layout file and then add to our \nconfigureView\n method:\n\n\nprivate void configureView() {\n    // ...\n\n    RecyclerView featuredEntitiesRecyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.featuredEntitiesRecyclerView);\n    OddListAdapter oddListAdapter = new OddListAdapter(featuredCollectionEntities);\n    LinearLayoutManager layoutManager = new LinearLayoutManager(this);\n    layoutManager.setOrientation(LinearLayoutManager.VERTICAL);\n    featuredEntitiesRecyclerView.setLayoutManager(layoutManager);\n    featuredEntitiesRecyclerView.setAdapter(oddListAdapter);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nOddListAdapter\n doesn't currently exist, so let's create that class.\n\n\n// app/java/sample.oddworks.com.myoddworksapplication/OddListAdapter\n\npackage sample.oddworks.com.myoddworksapplication;\n\nimport android.content.Context;\nimport android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView;\nimport android.view.LayoutInflater;\nimport android.view.View;\nimport android.view.ViewGroup;\nimport android.widget.TextView;\n\nimport java.util.List;\n\nimport io.oddworks.device.model.Media;\nimport io.oddworks.device.model.OddCollection;\nimport io.oddworks.device.model.OddObject;\n\npublic class OddListAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter\nOddListAdapter.ListItemViewHolder\n {\n    private List\nOddObject\n oddObjects;\n\n    public OddListAdapter(List\nOddObject\n oddObjects) {\n        super();\n\n        this.oddObjects = oddObjects;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public ListItemViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\n        View itemView = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.list_item, parent, false);\n        return new ListItemViewHolder(itemView);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onBindViewHolder(ListItemViewHolder holder, int position) {\n        OddObject oddObject = oddObjects.get(position);\n\n        switch (oddObject.getType()) {\n            case (OddObject.TYPE_LIVE_STREAM):\n            case (OddObject.TYPE_VIDEO):\n                Media oddMedia = (Media) oddObject;\n                holder.title.setText(oddMedia.getTitle());\n                break;\n            case (OddObject.TYPE_COLLECTION):\n                OddCollection oddCollection = (OddCollection) oddObject;\n                holder.title.setText(oddCollection.getTitle());\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getItemCount() {\n        if (oddObjects == null) {\n            return 0;\n        } else {\n            return oddObjects.size();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public final static class ListItemViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {\n        TextView title;\n\n        public ListItemViewHolder(View itemView) {\n            super(itemView);\n\n            title = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.listItemTitle);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nEverything in this adapter is pretty standard.

Based on what type it is, we cast the \noddObject\n to a \nMedia\n or \nOddCollection\n object.",

There's a lot going on here, so let's take a minute to walk through the code. We are first getting the  homeView  from our main application class. In the Oddworks dashboard we've set up relationships on this View with the keys of \"featuredMedia and \"featuredCollections\". We use the  getIdentifiersByRelationship  so that we can use the  OddStore 's  getObject  method to retrieve the featured media and featured collection objects later in the method. We check to make sure that each List of Identifiers is not null or empty and grab the object from the  OddStore . We take this a step further with the  getIncludedByRelationship  method called on the  featuredCollection . This will give us a list of  OddObject s that can be used in a RecyclerView.  Note: We're casting the objects in the  featuredCollectionEntities  to  OddObject s because it may contain any combination of data types.",

In order to render an image, we're going to rely on the  Glide  library, though there are many other options such as  Picasso ,  ImageLoader , and  Fresco . Add the Glide library to your project via Gradle or Maven.  After calling the  configureData  method, we're going to call a new method called  configureView .  // app/java/sample.oddworks.com.myoddworksapplication/HomeActivity\n\n// ...\nprivate void configureView() {\n    ImageView featuredMediaPreviewImage = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.featuredMediaPreviewImage);\n    Glide.with(context)\n            .load(featuredMedia.getMediaImage().getAspect16x9())\n            .placeholder(R.drawable.preview_tile_16x9)\n            .into(featuredMediaPreviewImage);\n}\n// ...  We've created an  ImageView  with an ID of  featuredMediaPreviewImage  in the  activity_home  layout file that is being targeted in the  configureView  method. We want to use an image with an aspect ratio of 16x9, although we do have other options. You'll also notice that we have set a placeholder via a drawable file. This is best practice because it allows for the view layout to have the correct structure on load instead of changing it after Glide has loaded the image from the  featuredMedia  object.",

            "text": "Since the  featuredCollectionEntities  list can contain different types of  OddObject s we'll need to create a dynamic  RecyclerView  to handle anything that gets put into it. For this example, we'll handle the case of the List containing  Media  and  OddCollection  objects. In order to make use of the  RecyclerView  class we'll need to add it to our dependencies in our  build.gradle  file:  dependencies {\n    // ...\n    compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:+'\n}  We'll add a  RecyclerView  to our  activity_home  layout file and then add to our  configureView  method:  private void configureView() {\n    // ...\n\n    RecyclerView featuredEntitiesRecyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.featuredEntitiesRecyclerView);\n    OddListAdapter oddListAdapter = new OddListAdapter(featuredCollectionEntities);\n    LinearLayoutManager layoutManager = new LinearLayoutManager(this);\n    layoutManager.setOrientation(LinearLayoutManager.VERTICAL);\n    featuredEntitiesRecyclerView.setLayoutManager(layoutManager);\n    featuredEntitiesRecyclerView.setAdapter(oddListAdapter);\n}  The  OddListAdapter  doesn't currently exist, so let's create that class.  // app/java/sample.oddworks.com.myoddworksapplication/OddListAdapter\n\npackage sample.oddworks.com.myoddworksapplication;\n\nimport android.content.Context;\nimport android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView;\nimport android.view.LayoutInflater;\nimport android.view.View;\nimport android.view.ViewGroup;\nimport android.widget.TextView;\n\nimport java.util.List;\n\nimport io.oddworks.device.model.Media;\nimport io.oddworks.device.model.OddCollection;\nimport io.oddworks.device.model.OddObject;\n\npublic class OddListAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter OddListAdapter.ListItemViewHolder  {\n    private List OddObject  oddObjects;\n\n    public OddListAdapter(List OddObject  oddObjects) {\n        super();\n\n        this.oddObjects = oddObjects;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public ListItemViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\n        View itemView = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.list_item, parent, false);\n        return new ListItemViewHolder(itemView);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onBindViewHolder(ListItemViewHolder holder, int position) {\n        OddObject oddObject = oddObjects.get(position);\n\n        switch (oddObject.getType()) {\n            case (OddObject.TYPE_LIVE_STREAM):\n            case (OddObject.TYPE_VIDEO):\n                Media oddMedia = (Media) oddObject;\n                holder.title.setText(oddMedia.getTitle());\n                break;\n            case (OddObject.TYPE_COLLECTION):\n                OddCollection oddCollection = (OddCollection) oddObject;\n                holder.title.setText(oddCollection.getTitle());\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getItemCount() {\n        if (oddObjects == null) {\n            return 0;\n        } else {\n            return oddObjects.size();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public final static class ListItemViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {\n        TextView title;\n\n        public ListItemViewHolder(View itemView) {\n            super(itemView);\n\n            title = (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.listItemTitle);\n        }\n    }\n}  Everything in this adapter is pretty standard. What deserves attention is the switch statement in the  onBindViewHolder . We use the  getType  method on our  oddObject  and compare it against any type that it could be. Based on what type it is, we cast the  oddObject  to a  Media  or  OddCollection  object.",
