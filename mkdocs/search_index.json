If there's a failure we should notify the user of this and give them the option to retry. \nWarning: if you try to manipulate the UI within this callback you will crash the application since you aren't running on the main thread. You must specify that you'd like to run on the main thread if you'd like to make any UI updates.\n\n\nGetting View Data from API\n\n\nAssuming the config request returns successful we can use the config object to set up many things about our app. For now, we'll only focus on the views that the config sends us.\n\n\n// app/java/sample.oddworks.com.oddsampleapp/SplashActivity\n\n// ...\nprivate final class ConfigRequestCallback implements OddCallback\nConfig\n {\n    @Override\n    public void onSuccess(Config config) {\n        Map\nString, String\n views = config.getViews();\n        String homeView = views.get(HOME_VIEW);\n        String menuView = views.get(MENU_VIEW);\n\n        apiCaller.getView(homeView, new ViewRequestCallback(HOME_VIEW));\n        apiCaller.getView(menuView, new ViewRequestCallback(MENU_VIEW));\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onFailure(final Exception exception) {\n        // handle failure\n    }\n}\n\nprivate final class ViewRequestCallback implements OddCallback\nOddView\n {\n    private String mViewType;\n\n    public ViewRequestCallback(String viewType) {\n        mViewType = viewType;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onSuccess(OddView view) {\n        OddApp oddApp = OddApp.getInstance();\n\n        if (getViewType().equals(HOME_VIEW)) {\n            oddApp.setHomeView(view);\n        } else if (getViewType().equals(MENU_VIEW)) {\n            oddApp.setMenuView(view);\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onFailure(final Exception exception) {\n        // handle failure\n    }\n\n    public String getViewType() {\n        return mViewType;\n    }\n}\n// ...\n\n\n\nHere, we're creating a new \nOddCallback\n for the views that we're requesting through the \napiCaller\n. This callback accepts a \nviewType\n parameter that will determine which view we're setting in our \nOddApp\n instance. Remember, the setter metods for each view utilize the \nOddStore\n so we'll have access to this information throughout the app if the member variables in \nOddApp\n get leaked from memory.\n\n\nThe last thing we need to do in our \nSplashActivity\n is launch a new Activity that will make use of all the data we've fetched. First we'll need to create a new Activity, we'll call ours \nHomeActivity\n. Now in the \nViewRequestCallback\n section of our \nSplashActivity\n we'll make sure we have all our data and launch a new Intent:\n\n\n// ...\n@Override\npublic void onSuccess(OddView view) {\n    OddApp oddApp = OddApp.getInstance();\n\n    if (getViewType().equals(HOME_VIEW)) {\n        oddApp.setHomeView(view);\n    } else if (getViewType().equals(MENU_VIEW)) {\n        oddApp.setMenuView(view);\n    }\n\n    if (oddApp.getHomeView() != null \n oddApp.getMenuView() != null) {\n        Intent home = new Intent(context, HomeActivity.class);\n        startActivity(home);\n    }\n}\n// ...",

Here, we're creating a new  OddCallback  for the views that we're requesting through the  apiCaller . This callback accepts a  viewType  parameter that will determine which view we're setting in our  OddApp  instance. Remember, the setter metods for each view utilize the  OddStore  so we'll have access to this information throughout the app if the member variables in  OddApp  get leaked from memory.  The last thing we need to do in our  SplashActivity  is launch a new Activity that will make use of all the data we've fetched. First we'll need to create a new Activity, we'll call ours  HomeActivity . Now in the  ViewRequestCallback  section of our  SplashActivity  we'll make sure we have all our data and launch a new Intent:  // ...\n@Override\npublic void onSuccess(OddView view) {\n    OddApp oddApp = OddApp.getInstance();\n\n    if (getViewType().equals(HOME_VIEW)) {\n        oddApp.setHomeView(view);\n    } else if (getViewType().equals(MENU_VIEW)) {\n        oddApp.setMenuView(view);\n    }\n\n    if (oddApp.getHomeView() != null   oddApp.getMenuView() != null) {\n        Intent home = new Intent(context, HomeActivity.class);\n        startActivity(home);\n    }\n}\n// ...",
