#### Oddworks Content Server
The Oddworks Android SDK is designed specifically as a client for the open source [Oddworks Content Server](https://github.com/oddnetworks/oddworks). Together the server and client allow you to structure your content and deliver it specifically to your application.

#### Oddworks Sample Apps
The [sample apps](https://github.com/oddnetworks/odd-sample-apps) are designed as reference apps for creating content rich applications for Android TV and mobile devices. These are open source as well, and should provide the quickest way to get started with this SDK for your app.

#### Oddworks Android Guide
The [Android guide](http://android.guide.oddnetworks.com/) contains the full documentation for working with Android devices in the Oddworks ecosystem.

Motivation
----------
The Oddworks Platform was designed and developed by [Odd Networks](https://www.oddnetworks.com/) to lower the barrier for developers and content owners to create your own streaming content network.

We proudly stand behind our open source work and, in addition to maintaining the Oddworks project, Odd Networks also provides hosted services, a Pro Dashboard, a Live Stream Generator, and a Recommendation Service.
