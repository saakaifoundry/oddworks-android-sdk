## Resources

#### Oddworks Content Server
The Oddworks Android SDK is designed specifically as a client for the open source [Oddworks Content Server](https://github.com/oddnetworks/oddworks). Together the server and client allow you to structure your content and deliver it specifically to your application.

#### Oddworks Sample Apps
The [sample apps](https://github.com/oddnetworks/odd-sample-apps) are designed as reference apps for creating content rich applications for Android TV and mobile devices. These are open source as well, and should provide the quickest way to get started with this SDK for your app.

* [Apple iOS & tvOS SDK](https://github.com/oddnetworks/oddworks-ios-tvos-sdk) Used for iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.
* Android SDK (you are here) Used for mobile, tablet, Android TV, and Fire TV.

_Coming soon:_

* Roku SDK
* JavaScript SDK for use in [Windows Universal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide) and web applications.

#### Oddworks Android Guide

## Technology

The Oddworks Platform is written for the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) runtime, and uses the well known [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) framework for HTTP communication.

Oddworks is designed to be database agnostic so long as the underlying database can support JSON document storage, including some RDMSs like PostgreSQL. Currently the only supported and tested database is MongoDB.

Although communication between the devices and the REST API is typically done in a synchronous way, the inner guts of the system is designed to communicate via asynchronous message passing. This makes it easier to extend the platform with plugins and other loosely coupled modules without worrying about upstream changes like you would in tightly coupled platforms.

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Oddworks is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/).

## Motivation

The Oddworks Platform was designed and developed by [Odd Networks](https://www.oddnetworks.com/) to lower the barrier for developers and content owners to create your own streaming content network. Based on our experience in video gaming we thought that TV could use a big improvement. We believe in the future of television and, with the Oddworks open source platform, we hope you'll make that future a reality.

We proudly stand behind our open source work and, in addition to maintaining the Oddworks project, Odd Networks also provides hosted services, a Pro Dashboard, a Live Stream Generator, and a Recommendation Service.
